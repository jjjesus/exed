ToDo
- How to add a CDATA section? Based on the use of tags
- Highlight line to make it easier to read the node-value pair
- Reload (when changed externally, either the file or the XSD)
- Search using XPath
- Replace text
- Drag and drop support
- How can make navigation with the keyboard easier: arrows, enter, insert, delete?
- Delete a node by pressing Delete
- Provide feedback when the search doesn't return a value

Bugs
- Check undo functionality, e.g. when deleting an attribute, I need to undo twice before it reappears
- When displaying the search window, and adding a new zone, an exception is raised (cannot reproduce this!).
When opening a new UPInit, and performing a search, an exception is raised in XmlViewModel.UpdateCommands (one of the commands hasn't been initialised).
- What to do with empty elements (that have a value).
- How can I delete a node that shouldn't be there, i.e. an element that should have no value?

For later
- XsltView doesn't scale
- Can I use this editor to create XSDs, just like an XML tree, with types as value, and an optional column for annotations. Use conventions to create an XSD, e.g. Book as child of Books should allow multiple.
- Optionally, add dotted lines to connect treelistitems
