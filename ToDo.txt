ToDo
- How can make navigation with the keyboard easier: arrows, enter, insert, delete?
- Expand (*)/collapse all children
- How to add a CDATA section? Based on the use of tags
- Search using XPath
- Replace text
- Drag and drop support
- Show a summary of errors and search results
- Provide installer + documentation
- Provide translator set

Bugs
- Check undo functionality, e.g. when deleting an attribute, I need to undo twice before it reappears
- What to do with empty elements (that have a value).
- How can I delete a node that shouldn't be there, i.e. an element that should have no value?

For later
- XsltView doesn't scale
- Reload (when changed externally, either the file or the XSD)
- Can I use this editor to create XSDs, just like an XML tree, with types as value, and an optional column for annotations. Use conventions to create an XSD, e.g. Book as child of Books should allow multiple.
- Optionally, add dotted lines to connect treelistitems
