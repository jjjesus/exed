ToDo
- Replace text
- Provide installer + documentation
- Provide translator set
- Expand (*)/collapse all children
- Manual reload
- CodeWindow with auto generated C# or VB code, and, using regex, replacing arrays with generic List, ObservableCollection or BindableCollection.
- How can make navigation with the keyboard easier: arrows, enter, insert, delete?
- Use shortcut key to step through validation errors

Bugs
- Check undo functionality, e.g. when deleting an attribute, I need to undo twice before it reappears
- What to do with empty elements (that have a value). --> Delete them? 

For later
- XsltView doesn't scale
- Reload (when changed externally, either the file or the XSD)
- Can I use this editor to create XSDs, just like an XML tree, with types as value, and an optional column for annotations. Use conventions to create an XSD, e.g. Book as child of Books should allow multiple.
- Optionally, add dotted lines to connect treelistitems

Remarks:
- How to add a CDATA section? Based on the use of tags?
This is a non-requirement: A CData section is only a special tag to tell the XmlReader that we need to escape certain characters like < or >.
However, it is equally valid to use &lt; instead of <, and that's what I'm doing here. So there is no need to ever create a CData section 
explicitly as we can already type < and >, and the XmlDocument already escapes them without the end user noticing.
