ToDo
- Multi-line textbox 
- Search functionality
- Reload (when changed externally)
- Print preview - could use WebBrowser's Print (preview)
- Refactor MVVM setup
- How to add a CDATA section?
- Check undo functionality
- How can make navigation with the keyboard easier: arrows, enter, insert, delete?

Bugs
- What to do with empty elements (that have a value).
- How can I delete a node that shouldn't be there, i.e. an element that should have no value?

For later
- XsltView doesn't scale
- Can I use this editor to create XSDs, just like an XML tree, with types as value, and an optional column for annotations
- Optionally, add dotted lines to connect treelistitems
